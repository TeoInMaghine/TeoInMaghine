Iâ€™m Teo Pirato Guthmann, a rookie programmer and game developer. 
I've had part in making the games on my [itch.io page](https://teopg.itch.io/), as well as programmed the [Pathfinding](https://github.com/TeoPirato/Pathfinding) and [Minesweeper](https://github.com/TeoPirato/Minesweeper) repositories in my [school account](https://github.com/TeoPirato).
