Iâ€™m Teo Pirato Guthmann, a rookie programmer and game developer. 
I've had part in making the games on my [itch.io page](https://teopg.itch.io/), as well as programmed the [Pathfinding repository](https://github.com/TeoPirato/Pathfinding). I use my [personal account](https://github.com/TeoInMaghine) to collaborate with other people and for projects made outside of school.
